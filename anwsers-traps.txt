1. a2, a0~a7 save the params

2. f and g call: inlined and computed at compile time
   located at 0x26: 45b1                	li	a1,12

3. printf: 0x616

4. 0x38

5. He110 World

   No need to change 57616, since it is a hex
   constant to 0xE110.

   For little endian, the reading order is:
   First, the byte 72, refers to 'r' in ASCII,
   Second, the byte 6c, refers to 'l', and so on.  
   So, it should be: "rld\0".

   For big endian, i will equal to 0x726c6400.

6. It will get the dirty data in the register a2. For my 
   case, it is 1.
